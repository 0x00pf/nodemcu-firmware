# NodeMCU Documentation

NodeMCU is an [eLua](http://www.eluaproject.net/) based firmware for the [ESP8266 WiFi SOC from Espressif](http://espressif.com/en/products/esp8266/). This is a companion project to the popular [NodeMCU dev kits](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-devkit-v1.0), ready-made open source development boards with ESP8266-12E chips.

The firmware is based on the Espressif SDK v1.4 and uses a file system based on [spiffs](https://github.com/pellepl/spiffs).
