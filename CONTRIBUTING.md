## Contributing

Thank you everyone for contributing to this project.

Pull requests for new features and major fixes should be opened against the `dev` branch.

Avoid intermediate merge commits. Rebase your feature branch onto `dev` to pull updates and
verify your local changes against them before placing the pull request.

*Note that the `pre_build` bin in the dev branch is never up-to-date.*
